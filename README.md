# CommentToxicityNLP
The internet can be a mean and nasty place...but it doesn't need to be! Learn how to spot and detect toxic comments using deep learning and Python. The dataset leveraged is originally from Kaggle but you could sub this out for your own data plus I'll show you how to make predictions from raw strings as well!
